Hi! My name is Oleksii Zeleniuk.

I’m a Freelance (fullstack) software developer based in Hamburg. Since 2009 I work as a software developer for <a href="/references">various companies</a> where I was focusing on architecting and building web-based applications as well as taking care of infrastructure, test automation and a little bit of frontend.

I started building software with PHP first but nowadays it's not limited to that and I enjoy projects in Node.js, Typescript, Kotlin, Python, etc. I'm especially happy to work with AWS services.

I do speak Ukrainian, Russian, English and German languages.

On a personal note, I'm into a sport (like football, jogging, judo etc.), traveling and exploring new music.
I was born in Prag (Czech Republic), grew up in Kyiv (Ukraine) and currently live in Hamburg (Germany).
I have a master's degree in Computer science at <a href="http://kpi.ua/en" target="_blank">The National Technical University of Ukraine</a>.
