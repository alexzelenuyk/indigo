<p>
Hi! My name is Oleksii Zeleniuk.
</p>

<p>
I was born in Prag (Czech Republic), grew up in Kyiv (Ukraine) and currently live in Hamburg (Germany).
I have a master degree in Computer science at <a href="http://kpi.ua/en" target="_blank">The National Technical University of Ukraine</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since 2009 I work as a software developer in <a href="/experience">various companies</a> where I was focusing on building web-based tools and systems as well as taking care about infrastructure, test automation and a little bit of frontend.
</p>

<p>
I started building software with PHP first but nowadays it's not limited to that and I enjoy projects in Python, Go, Node.js, Typescript etc. I'm especially happy to work with AWS services. 
<p>

<p>
On a personal note, I'm into a sport (like judo, football, jogging), traveling and exploring new music.
<p>

<p>
I do speak Ukrainian, Russian, English and German languages.
